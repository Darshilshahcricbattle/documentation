## Salary Cap Rules for Leaderborads Set Up
**Navigation**
 **League Home > Rules > Leaderboards**

The **Leaderboards** section introduces additional customization for how league rankings and top performers are displayed and calculated. These options provide enhanced visibility, allow tracking of performance over tournament phases, and can focus leaderboard calculations on a subset of high-achieving users within each team.

## 1. Advanced Leaderboards

* **Purpose:**
  To make league participation more engaging by offering multiple leaderboard categories that track and reward various achievements, not just total points.

* **Explanation:**

  * When enabled, the system provides a range of themed leaderboards. These can include categories like:

    * Purple Cap
    * Orange & Blue Cap
    * Diamond Bat
    * Diamond Ball
    * Smarty Pants
    * Match Controller
  * Each leaderboard tracks a specific statistic (e.g., most runs, most wickets, best overall player, etc.).
  * Users can compete for top spots in each category, creating more ways to win and more reasons to participate in every match.

* **Configuration Options:**

  * **Default:** No (Disabled)
  * **Purchased:** Yes
  * **Amount:** Rs1500

## 2. Manage Phase Wise Leaderboard

* **Purpose:**
  To give more granularity in tracking performance, especially in tournaments that have distinct phases (e.g., group stage, playoffs, finals).

* **Explanation:**

  * Allows the League Manager to split the tournament into multiple phases.
  * For each phase, a separate leaderboard is created and maintained.
  * This helps users see who is performing best in each part of the tournament (for example, tracking separate winners for league stage and playoffs).
  * Especially useful for long tournaments or leagues with mid-season resets.

* **Configuration Options:**

  * **Default:** Not Applicable
  * **Purchased:** Yes
  * **Amount:** Rs15000

## 3. Leaderboard will show points for these X no. of players only

* **Purpose:**
  To focus on rewarding only the top contributors within each team, which can increase competition among team members and prevent inactive users from affecting team scores.

* **Explanation:**

  * Instead of accumulating points for every team member, the League Manager can specify that only the top X performing playersâ€™ points count towards the leaderboard.
  * This means that if you set X to 5, only the five highest-scoring players from each team are considered in the overall leaderboard calculation.
  * This can be particularly beneficial in large leagues or organizations where not every participant is active or engaged for all matches.

* **Configuration Options:**

  * **Default:** Not Applicable (NA)
  * **Purchased:** Yes
  * **Amount:** Rs1500

## Notes and Recommendations

* All leaderboard customizations are **premium features** and require additional purchase.
* Only the League Manager (person who created the league) can enable or change these settings.
* Changes to leaderboard logic will directly affect how team and individual standings are calculated and displayed in the league portal.
* Consider combining phase-wise and advanced leaderboards for the most dynamic and engaging user experience.
