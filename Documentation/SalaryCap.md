## Salary Cap

The **Salary Cap** format on CricBattle is a traditional fantasy cricket model, similar to ESPNcricinfo and IPL-style fantasy leagues. In this mode, each participant builds a team within a fixed virtual budget, ensuring balanced team creation and strategic player selection.

### Key Features:
- **Fixed Budget**: Users are provided with a limited virtual currency (salary cap) to select their squad.
- **Team Composition**: Users must select players from various real-life teams while staying within the budget.
- **Points System**: Players earn points based on their real-life match performance (runs, wickets, catches, etc.).
- **Multiple League Types**:
  - **Tournament Leagues**: Span across an entire tournament (e.g., IPL, ODI series).
  - **Daily Leagues**: Focus on daily matches for quicker engagement and results.
- **League Visibility**:
  - **Join Public**: Participate in open leagues hosted by others.
  - **Join Private**: Enter a league using an invitation code.
  - **Create Private**: Host your own league and invite friends.

### How It Works:
1. **Create or Join a League**: Public or private.
2. **Customize League Settings** (for creators): Define scoring rules, team size, match duration, etc.
3. **Build Your Team**: Select players while respecting the budget cap.
4. **Manage Team**: Make adjustments before deadlines.
5. **Compete**: Your teamâ€™s performance is tracked live.
6. **Track Rankings**: Monitor your position on the leaderboard.

### Benefits:
- Encourages **strategic thinking** within budget limits.
- Allows fair play since all users operate under the same salary cap.
- Suitable for both **casual** and **competitive** users.
