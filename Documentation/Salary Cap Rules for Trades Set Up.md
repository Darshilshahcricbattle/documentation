## Salary Cap Rules for Trades Set Up
 **Nagivation** 
 **League Home > Rules > Trades**

The **Trades** section allows the League Manager to control and fine-tune how many team changes ("trades") can be made throughout the league or tournament. This is crucial for balancing skill, strategy, and engagement across all league participants.

### Main Trade Settings

#### Number of trades allowed
- **Description:** Sets the total number of trades (player substitutions) each team can make from the start of the tournament until the final match.
- **Default:** 210
- **Editable:** Yes, by League Manager.
- **Note:** Trades can be reset or restricted before playoffs using the settings below.

#### Free Trades for Each Match/Round
- **Description:** Specifies how many trades are free for each match or round. Users are not penalized for these free trades.
- **Default:** 1
- **Editable:** Yes.

#### Carry Forward Free Trades

- **Default:** 2
- **Editable:** Yes.

#### Additional charges for using extra trades
- **Description:** Once all allowed trades are exhausted, managers can purchase additional trades, but at the cost of losing fantasy points for each extra trade.
- **Default:** Not Applicable (NA)
- **Editable:** Yes. The League Manager sets the point cost per extra trade.

#### Lock to Lock Trade

### Playoff Trade Settings

> **Note:** If any of these playoff trade settings are enabled, the standard trade settings above apply only to matches before the playoff stage begins.

#### Allow separate trades during playoff matches
- **Description:** If enabled, allows the League Manager to specify a new set of trade rules (number of trades, free trades, etc.) that apply only to the playoff matches, separate from the group stage.
- **Default:** Yes
- **Editable:** Yes.

#### Number of trades during Playoffs
- **Description:** Sets the total number of trades each team can make specifically during the playoff matches.
- **Default:** 10
- **Editable:** Yes.

#### Free Trades for Each Match/Round during Playoffs
- **Description:** Number of free trades each team is allowed per playoff match or round. If trades are unlimited in playoffs, this setting does not apply.
- **Default:** 1
- **Editable:** Yes.

#### Allow free trades until 1st match of Playoff starts
- **Description:** When enabled, team managers can make unlimited trades after the last match of the group stage until the first playoff match begins. This allows last-minute adjustments as teams transition into the playoffs.
- **Default:** Yes
- **Editable:** Yes.

### Editing and Permissions

- **Who can edit:** Only the League Manager can adjust trade settings.
- **Premium/Purchased settings:** Certain advanced options (like "Lock to Lock Trade") require a separate purchase (Rs 1500) to unlock.
- **Update changes:** After making changes, use the **Update** button to save and apply all settings for the league.

### Strategic Impact

- Trade limits and free trade carry-over policies encourage managers to plan ahead, rather than making impulsive or unlimited changes.
- Playoff-specific settings allow for a different level of strategy as the league approaches its most competitive phase.
- Restricting trades during critical stages can raise the skill ceiling and level the playing field among experienced and casual players.

### Summary

The **Trades** section is one of the most important settings in the Salary Cap league configuration. By thoughtfully customizing trade allowances, carry-over policies, and playoff rules, League Managers create an environment that rewards both careful planning and cricketing insight.
