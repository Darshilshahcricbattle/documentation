## Prediction Fantasy (CricBattle)

### Overview

Prediction Fantasy on CricBattle allows users to participate in leagues where they forecast match outcomes and answer specific cricket-related questions. Instead of managing teams, users make predictions for each match and accumulate points or correct answers. Prizes are awarded based on either the number of correct answers or leaderboard ranking by prediction points.
