## Salary Cap Rules for Extra Scoring Set Up
**Navigation**
**League Home > Rules > Extra Scoring**

The **Extra Scoring** section allows League Managers to fine-tune how total scores are calculated in their fantasy league by setting up exclusion rules and bonus points for top performers. These options are primarily designed to give more flexibility and reward consistency or high achievement, and are only available in the **Traditional Point Based Matchwise format**.

## 1. Exclude Low Fantasy Points Matches

* **Purpose:**
  To avoid penalizing users for their weakest performances, especially in longer tournaments with many matches. This setting allows you to exclude a certain number of the lowest-scoring matches from a team's total points.

* **Explanation:**

  * *Only applicable in Traditional Point Based Matchwise format.*
  * Lets the League Manager select how many matches with the lowest fantasy points for each team will be ignored when calculating the overall total score for the league standings.
  * For example, if you set this value to 2, the two matches with the least points for each team will not count toward their total score at the end of the tournament.
  * This can benefit participants who had a few poor matches due to missed deadlines or bad luck, ensuring that one or two bad games do not ruin their chances in the overall league.

* **Configuration Options:**

  * **Exclude Number of matches with low fantasy points:**
    Set the number of lowest-point matches to be excluded from total score.
    *Default:* Not Applicable (NA)
    *Purchased:* Yes
    *Amount:* Rs2000

## 2. Bonus Points for Match Top 3 Winners

* **Purpose:**
  To incentivize users to strive for high match rankings, this setting awards extra points to the top 3 users in each match, boosting competition and engagement.

* **Explanation:**

  * *Only applicable in Traditional Point Based Matchwise format.*
  * After each match, the system determines the top 3 ranked users (based on fantasy points for that match) and awards them additional bonus points.
  * This setting is ideal for leagues that want to reward not just consistency but also “peak performance,” encouraging users to aim for a top finish in every match.
  * Bonus points are added to the match points earned by users in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for that specific match.
