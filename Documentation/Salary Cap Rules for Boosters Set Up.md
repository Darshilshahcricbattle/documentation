## Salary Cap Rules for Booster Set Up
 **Nagivation**  
 **League Home > Rules > Boosters**

The **Boosters** feature in CricBattle’s fantasy leagues allows both league managers and individual team members to activate special enhancements for specific matches. These boosters are designed to temporarily modify gameplay conditions or scoring, providing unique strategic opportunities and increased engagement. Boosters can either be assigned centrally by the league manager for all league members or individually used by team managers for specific matches. Understanding how each booster works and its limitations is essential for maximizing their effectiveness.

### 1. Team Boosters (Auto Assigned by League Manager)

#### Overview

League Managers can assign certain boosters to matches ahead of time. When a booster is auto-assigned, it is activated for all members of the league for that particular match. The assignment must be completed before the lock time of the preceding match.

* **Assignment Mechanism:** Via the "Manage" option, the manager selects which matches get which booster. This ensures coordinated strategic play and a level playing field for all teams during those matches.
* **Activation Timing:** Once assigned, the booster becomes active automatically for the target match as soon as the previous match’s lock time has expired.

### 2. Team Boosters (Individual Use by League Members)

#### Overview

Team managers can individually apply certain boosters to their own teams, but must do so **before the match’s lock time**. These boosters provide team-specific advantages for a limited number of matches or rounds.

## Booster Types and Rules

### 2x Booster

* **Purpose:** Allows a team to double the points earned in a single match (applicable only in Salary Cap – Traditional Point Based leagues).
* **Restrictions:** Only the points earned by the selected players in that match are doubled. This does **not** apply if team updates are disabled for individual matches.
* **Limit:** By default, each team can use this booster for one match (can be increased by the manager).

---

### Trade Booster

* **Purpose:** Grants free additional trades for one match or round.
* **Usage:** Only applicable if there is a trade limit in the league.
* **Settings:**

  * **No. of matches/rounds allowed:** How many times this booster can be used.
  * **Trade counts per match/round:** How many free trades are granted when the booster is active (can be set to Unlimited).
* **Note:** Not available if unlimited trades are already enabled for the league.

### Budget Booster

* **Purpose:** Temporarily increases the budget available for team selection in a specific match or round.
* **Settings:**

  * Number of matches/rounds where budget booster can be used (default: 1).
  * Amount of budget increase (can be set to Unlimited).

---

### Team Freedom Booster

* **Purpose:** Removes typical selection restrictions for a single match/round. While active, managers can select players from any role, any number of overseas or uncapped players, and there are **no team balance restrictions**.
* **Restoration:** The previous team is automatically restored after the match/round in which the booster was used.

---

### Mega Freedom Booster

* **Purpose:** An enhanced version of the Team Freedom Booster. In addition to removing all team balance, overseas, and uncapped restrictions, it also provides **unlimited trades and budget** for that match/round.
* **Restoration:** Previous team setup is restored for subsequent matches.

---

### 3x C-VC Booster

* **Purpose:** Triples the points for both the Captain and Vice-Captain in the selected match.
* **Usage:** Can only be applied once per season by default (configurable by the manager).

---

### Super Player Booster

* **Purpose:** Multiplies the points of a designated “super player” by a specific factor (default: 5x) for one match/round.
* **Settings:** The multiplier can be adjusted by the league manager.
* **Restriction:** Usually limited to one use per team per season.

---

### Bench Booster

* **Purpose:** For one match/round, the points scored by bench players are also counted towards the team’s total, in addition to the starting lineup.
* **Usage:** Limited to one match by default, but configurable by manager.

---

### Free Hit Booster

* **Purpose:** Provides unlimited trades for a single match/round, allowing complete overhaul of the team without penalty for that period.
* **Restoration:** After the match, the previous team is reinstated for upcoming matches.

## Key Notes on Booster Usage

* **Assignment:** Some boosters must be assigned by the League Manager (such as auto-assigned team boosters), while others can be applied at the discretion of the team manager (individual use).
* **Timing:** Boosters must always be activated before the lock time of the match to which they apply. Late assignments are not allowed.
* **Restoration:** For boosters that significantly alter team structure (e.g., Team Freedom, Mega Freedom, Free Hit), the team is automatically reset to its previous composition after the boosted match.
* **Limits:** Each booster’s usage is typically restricted by the league configuration. The manager can increase the number of uses for each booster per team.
* **Compatibility:** Some boosters, such as Trade Booster, are not available if their underlying setting (e.g., unlimited trades) is already enabled in the league.

## Strategy Tips

* **Plan Booster Use Early:** Teams should coordinate with their managers (or plan individually) when to deploy each booster for maximum strategic gain, especially for key matches or playoffs.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Some boosters, like Team Freedom and Mega Freedom, can drastically change your lineup for one match but return you to your old team immediately after. Use them wisely for crucial fixtures.
* **Watch for Lock Times:** Boosters cannot be assigned or activated after the match lock time, so always plan ahead.
